# Integrated-single-cell-proteomic-and-transcriptomic-landscape-of-mouse-folliculogenesis
Scripts perform end-to-end single-cell proteome+transcriptome analysis: load/preprocess matrices, normalize/cluster, UMAP/visualize, differential and enrichment, metabolic/mitochondrial features, ARACNe/VIPER TF activity, ligand–receptor   CCI, trajectory/phylovelo exports to reproduce main/supplementary figures.<br>
**other research.csv**: Column 1 lists the proteins identified in mouse secondary and antral follicles reported by Zhang et al. (Zhang S, Mu L, Wang H, Xu X, Jia L, Niu S, et al. Quantitative proteomic analysis uncovers protein-expression profiles during gonadotropin-dependent folliculogenesis in mice. Biol Reprod. 2023;108:479–491). Column 2 contains the proteins identified in mouse oocytes reported by Li et al. (Li Q, Mu L, Yang X, Wang G, Liang J, Wang S, et al. Discovery of oogenesis biomarkers from mouse oocytes using a single-cell proteomics approach. J Proteome Res. 2023;22:2067–2078). Column 3 lists the proteins identified in oocytes reported by Sun et al. (Sun H, Sun G, Zhang H, An H, Guo Y, Ge J, et al. Proteomic profiling reveals the molecular control of oocyte maturation. Mol Cell Proteomics. 2023;22:100481).
